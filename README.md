# Project 2 - Mystical Musicians Store

##### This Entity Relationship model within the Microsoft Dataverse supports the Mystic Musicians Application. The Mystic Musicians team implemented the use of Dataverse through the Microsoft Power Platform to create the necessary tables, forms, and relationships required for the success of the Mystical Musician business. Consisting of data and metadata, our tables generate one-to-many relationships and many-to-one relationships to effectively allow entities to communicate with each other. The Mystic Musicians Application goal is to allow a user to start a shopping session, generate a cart, and select products from a store. Once the user has finalized their choices, then an order could either be canceled or created. If created, a formal invoice of the order details would be presented to the customer, along with the payment details.
